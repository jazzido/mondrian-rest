A REST endpoint for [Mondrian](http://community.pentaho.com/projects/mondrian/)

## Usage

See [`mondrian-rest-demo`](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest-demo) and [`mondrian-rest-foodmart`](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest-foodmart) for example OLAP cubes implemented with `mondrian-rest`.

[`mondrian-rest-ui`](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest-ui) is an experimental visualization tool for `mondrian-rest`, inspired by [CubesViewer](https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer) and [Polestar](https://github.com/vega/polestar).

## Credits

Initial inspiration for this project came from [Stefan Urbanek](https://github.com/Stiivi)'s [`cubes`](http://cubes.databrewery.org/) OLAP server. `mondrian-rest` uses [Raimonds Simanovskis](https://github.com/rsim)'s fantastic [`mondrian-olap`](https://github.com/rsim/mondrian-olap) library.
